# VET CLINIC

> In this project I used relational database to create the initial data structure for a Vet clinic.
> I created a 3 tables to store information about the various animals, their owners and species. 
> I wrote queries using JOIN and aggregates to analyze the data from the multiple tables.
> I created 2 join tables to also implement many-to-many queries and analysis


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
